# Hands on 
**First Normal Form (1NF)**

This normalization level ensures that each column in your data contains only atomic values.

**Second Normal Form (2NF)**

Eliminates partial dependencies by ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key. What this means, in essence, is that there should be a direct relationship between each column and the primary key, and not between other columns.

**Third Normal Form (3NF)**

Removes transitive dependencies by ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key. This level of normalization builds on 2NF.
